# California-housing-dataset


The California housing dataset provides various features related to housing, and there are several interesting questions you can explore in this project: 

1. What is the distribution of median house values?

2. Analyze the range, mean, and distribution of the 'median_house_value' column to understand the overall pricing trend.
How does the median income correlate with the median house value?

3. Investigate the relationship between 'median_income' and 'median_house_value' to understand if higher incomes correspond to higher house values.
Which areas have the highest and lowest median house values?

4. Identify geographical regions with the highest and lowest median house values by analyzing 'longitude' and 'latitude'.
Is there a correlation between housing age and median house value?

5. Explore if there's a relationship between 'housing_median_age' and 'median_house_value' to determine if newer or older houses tend to have higher values.
How does the housing density (population per household) vary across different regions?

6. Calculate the housing density by dividing 'population' by 'households' and analyze its distribution across different areas.
What is the correlation between the number of rooms and median house value?

7. Investigate if 'total_rooms' has a correlation with 'median_house_value' to understand how the size of the houses influences their values.
Are there any patterns in the distribution of total bedrooms and total rooms?

8. Examine if there's a consistent ratio or pattern between 'total_bedrooms' and 'total_rooms' across different houses.
How does the population relate to housing density?

9. Explore the relationship between 'population' and the housing density to understand if higher population areas have higher or lower housing density.
10. What is the overall distribution of housing ages in the dataset?

11. Visualize the distribution of 'housing_median_age' to identify common age ranges for houses in the dataset.
Is there a correlation between location (longitude and latitude) and housing features/values?

12. Analyze if specific regions (defined by 'longitude' and 'latitude') exhibit particular housing characteristics or values.
These questions can serve as a starting point for your project and help you gain insights into various aspects of the California housing market.
